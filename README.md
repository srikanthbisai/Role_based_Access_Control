# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash 
   npm install
```
This helps in installing all the packages after cloning the repository from
```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikanthbisai/Role_based_Access_Control.git
```
and run 

```bash
 npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### PROJECT DETAILS 

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Project - Access Control Manager
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with a responsive user interface, enabling user and role management with efficient CRUD operations. It showcases modern web development practices using React and TypeScript with Material-UI components for a polished and professional UI/UX.

🛠️ Features
     ⭐️ Frontend
          Built With: React + TypeScript for type-safe development.
          UI/UX:
          Material-UI components for dialogs, grids, and responsiveness.
          Slider animations for toggling user active status.
               Feedback and Validation:
                    Toast notifications for success/error messages using react-toastify.
                    Regex-based email validation.

  Optimization Approaches:
                 Code splitting and custom hooks for modularity.
                 Centralized error handling using try-catch.
                 Search & Filter:
                 Search users by name with optimized filtering logic.

  Responsive Design:
                 Fully mobile-friendly layout.


Backend
     Mock JSON Server:
     Provides backend functionality for CRUD operations.
     Deployed on Render.com. Note: The server may take up to 30 seconds to start if idle.
