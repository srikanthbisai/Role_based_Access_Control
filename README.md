The backend is deployed on Render.com which might take a little time to serve responses as it gets shut down when not hit constantly.
Backend Repo is located at (https://github.com/srikanthbisai/json_server_render)

The project has packages 
 ```bash
    toastify, json-server, react-icons, emotion/react, emotion/styled,emotion/styled, mui/icons-material,mui/material, axios, react-icons, react-router-dom, react-toastify, tailwindcss, typescript,

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Project
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with a responsive user interface, enabling user and role management with efficient CRUD operations. It showcases modern web development practices using React and TypeScript with Material-UI components for a polished and professional UI/UX.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
      Frontend
          Built With: React + TypeScript for type-safe development.
          UI/UX:
          Material-UI components for dialogs, grids, and responsiveness.
          Slider animations for toggling user active status.
              Feedback and Validation:
                 Toast notifications for success/error messages using react-toastify.
                 Regex-based email validation.

  Optimization Approaches:
                 Code splitting and custom hooks for modularity.
                 Centralized error handling using try-catch.
                 Search & Filter:
                 Search users by name with optimized filtering logic.

  Responsive Design:
                 Fully mobile-friendly layout.



Backend
     Mock JSON Server:
     Provides backend functionality for CRUD operations.
     Deployed on Render.com. Note: The server may take up to 30 seconds to start if idle.
